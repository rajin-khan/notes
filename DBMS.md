## **What is a Database?**  
A **database** is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient data management, retrieval, and updating. Databases serve as the backbone of almost every software application, enabling structured storage and quick access to data.

### **Characteristics of a Database:**
1. **Data Organization:** Data is stored in tables, files, or collections for easy management.  
2. **Persistent Storage:** Data remains stored even after the system shuts down.  
3. **Scalability:** Databases can handle increasing amounts of data and users.  
4. **Security:** Access control ensures that only authorized users can interact with the data.

## **What is a DBMS?**  
A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that provides tools to create, retrieve, update, and manage databases. It acts as a bridge between users and the database, enabling efficient interaction while ensuring data consistency, integrity, and security.

### **Functions of a DBMS:**
1. **Data Storage and Retrieval:** Ensures data is stored efficiently and can be retrieved with minimal latency.  
2. **Data Integrity:** Maintains accuracy and reliability of data through constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.  
3. **Data Security:** Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.  
4. **Concurrency Control:** Manages simultaneous access by multiple users.  
5. **Backup and Recovery:** Automates backups and recovers data in case of failure.

## **Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases**

### **Relational Databases**
- **Definition:** Store data in tables (rows and columns) with relationships between them.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Structured Data:** Each table has a fixed schema.  
  - **Keys:** Primary and foreign keys link data across tables.  
  - **ACID Properties:** Ensure transactional reliability.

**Examples:**  
1. **MySQL:** Popular for web development.  
2. **PostgreSQL:** Advanced relational features with extensibility.  
3. **Oracle Database:** Enterprise-level relational database.

**Use Case:**  
E-commerce platforms where user, product, and transaction data are linked.

**Schema Example:**  
| User_ID | Name   | Email            |  
|---------|--------|------------------|  
| 1       | Alice  | alice@mail.com   |  
| 2       | Bob    | bob@mail.com     |  

| Order_ID | User_ID | Product_Name |  
|----------|---------|--------------|  
| 101      | 1       | Laptop       |  
| 102      | 2       | Headphones   |  

---

### **Non-Relational Databases** (NoSQL)
- **Definition:** Store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data in formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Schema-Free:** Flexible data models.  
  - **Horizontal Scalability:** Handles large datasets across distributed systems.  
  - **CAP Theorem:** Trades consistency, availability, or partition tolerance based on use.

**Examples:**  
1. **MongoDB:** Document-based, stores data in JSON-like format.  
2. **Redis:** Key-value store, used for caching and real-time applications.  
3. **Cassandra:** Column-family store, excellent for large-scale systems.

**Use Case:**  
Social media applications where user data is highly dynamic and varied.

**Document Example (MongoDB):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    {"order_id": 101, "product_name": "Laptop"},
    {"order_id": 102, "product_name": "Mouse"}
  ]
}
```

## **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**

### **Definition:**  
ER diagrams are visual representations of entities (tables) and their relationships in a database. They are essential for database design, helping to structure data logically and avoid redundancy.

### **Components of ER Diagrams:**
1. **Entities:** Objects in the database (e.g., `User`, `Product`).  
2. **Attributes:** Properties of entities (e.g., `Name`, `Price`).  
3. **Relationships:** Connections between entities (e.g., `User` *places* `Order`).  
4. **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies a record in a table.  
5. **Foreign Key:** Links one table to another.

### **Example:**
Consider a database for an e-commerce website:

**Entities:**  
- User (User_ID, Name, Email)  
- Product (Product_ID, Name, Price)  
- Order (Order_ID, User_ID, Product_ID, Date)  

**Relationships:**  
- User places an Order.  
- Order contains Products.

# **Normalization in Database Design**  

Normalization is a critical concept in database design aimed at organizing data efficiently to minimize redundancy and dependency issues. It involves dividing a database into multiple related tables and defining relationships between them to ensure data integrity and consistency.  

---

## **Why Normalize a Database?**  

### **Key Benefits of Normalization:**
1. **Eliminates Redundancy:** Avoids storing duplicate data, saving storage and simplifying updates.  
2. **Prevents Anomalies:** Reduces issues during **insert**, **update**, or **delete** operations.  
   - **Insertion Anomaly:** Difficulty adding data without requiring unrelated data.  
   - **Update Anomaly:** Inconsistencies due to data being updated in some places but not others.  
   - **Deletion Anomaly:** Loss of valuable information when deleting irrelevant data.  
3. **Improves Data Integrity:** Ensures consistent and accurate data through defined relationships.  
4. **Enhances Query Efficiency:** Organized data makes retrieval faster and easier.  

---

## **Forms of Normalization**

Normalization is categorized into different "normal forms" (NF), each with specific rules to improve database design.

---

### **1. First Normal Form (1NF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values.  
- Each row must be unique and have a primary key.  

**Violation Example:**  
| Order_ID | Product | Quantity   |  
|----------|---------|------------|  
| 1        | Pen, Eraser | 20, 10 |  

The column `Product` contains multiple values, violating 1NF.  

**Normalized Table:**  
| Order_ID | Product  | Quantity |  
|----------|----------|----------|  
| 1        | Pen      | 20       |  
| 1        | Eraser   | 10       |  

---

### **2. Second Normal Form (2NF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Must be in 1NF.  
- Remove **partial dependency**, where non-key attributes depend on only part of the composite primary key.  

**Violation Example:**  
| Student_ID | Course   | Instructor   | Department  |  
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|  
| 1          | Math     | Dr. Smith    | Math Dept   |  
| 2          | Physics  | Dr. Brown    | Physics Dept|  

Here, `Instructor` and `Department` depend on the `Course` and not the composite key (`Student_ID, Course`).  

**Normalized Tables:**  
1. **Student-Course Table:**  
   | Student_ID | Course   |  
   |------------|----------|  
   | 1          | Math     |  
   | 2          | Physics  |  

2. **Course-Details Table:**  
   | Course   | Instructor   | Department  |  
   |----------|--------------|-------------|  
   | Math     | Dr. Smith    | Math Dept   |  
   | Physics  | Dr. Brown    | Physics Dept|  

---

### **3. Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Must be in 2NF.  
- Remove **transitive dependency**, where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes.  

**Violation Example:**  
| Employee_ID | Name   | Dept_ID  | Dept_Name |  
|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|  
| 101         | Alice  | 1        | HR        |  
| 102         | Bob    | 2        | IT        |  

Here, `Dept_Name` depends on `Dept_ID`, not directly on the primary key (`Employee_ID`).  

**Normalized Tables:**  
1. **Employee Table:**  
   | Employee_ID | Name   | Dept_ID |  
   |-------------|--------|---------|  
   | 101         | Alice  | 1       |  
   | 102         | Bob    | 2       |  

2. **Department Table:**  
   | Dept_ID | Dept_Name |  
   |---------|-----------|  
   | 1       | HR        |  
   | 2       | IT        |  

---

### **4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Must be in 3NF.  
- For every functional dependency (X ‚Üí Y), X must be a superkey.  

**Violation Example:**  
| Student_ID | Course   | Instructor |  
|------------|----------|------------|  
| 1          | Math     | Dr. Smith  |  
| 2          | Math     | Dr. Brown  |  

Here, `Course` determines `Instructor`, but `Course` is not a superkey.  

**Normalized Tables:**  
1. **Student-Course Table:**  
   | Student_ID | Course   |  
   |------------|----------|  
   | 1          | Math     |  
   | 2          | Math     |  

2. **Course-Instructor Table:**  
   | Course   | Instructor |  
   |----------|------------|  
   | Math     | Dr. Smith  |  
   | Math     | Dr. Brown  |  

---

### **5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Must be in BCNF.  
- Remove multi-valued dependencies, where one attribute depends on another, independently of the primary key.  

**Violation Example:**  
| Student_ID | Language  | Sport     |  
|------------|-----------|-----------|  
| 1          | English   | Tennis    |  
| 1          | French    | Tennis    |  

Here, `Language` and `Sport` are independent of each other but linked via `Student_ID`.  

**Normalized Tables:**  
1. **Student-Language Table:**  
   | Student_ID | Language  |  
   |------------|-----------|  
   | 1          | English   |  
   | 1          | French    |  

2. **Student-Sport Table:**  
   | Student_ID | Sport     |  
   |------------|-----------|  
   | 1          | Tennis    |  

---

### **6. Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**  
**Rule:**  
- Must be in 4NF.  
- Deals with cases where data is reconstructed using **join dependencies** but without data loss.  

**Example:**  
Suppose a student can study multiple subjects under multiple professors. Breaking this into separate tables avoids redundancy.

## **Highlighting SQL (Structured Query Language)**  

**SQL** is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases.  

### **Basic SQL Syntax**  

1. **Create Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50),
       position VARCHAR(50),
       salary FLOAT
   );
   ```

2. **Insert Data:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees (id, name, position, salary)
   VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Manager', 75000);
   ```

3. **Select Data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
   ```

4. **Update Data:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000 WHERE id = 1;
   ```

5. **Delete Data:**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
   ```

---

### **Advanced SQL Features**

1. **Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables.  
   ```sql
   SELECT employees.name, departments.name
   FROM employees
   INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
   ```

2. **Aggregate Functions:** Perform calculations on data.  
   - `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`.  
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
   ```

3. **Subqueries:** Nested queries for advanced filtering.  
   ```sql
   SELECT name
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
   ```

4. **Indexes:** Speed up data retrieval.  
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);
   ```

5. **Views:** Create virtual tables.  
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW high_earners AS
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
   ```
